## Fabric Users:

There are no plans to port Ghostwriter to Fabric, but I've recently been made aware of Stendhal - a similar mod for 
Fabric: https://modrinth.com/mod/stendhal

Please note that Ghostwriter and the Maester Alliance are not affiliated with Stendhal. Issues with it should 
be directed to their [Gitlab issues page](https://gitlab.com/NebSpacefarer/stendhal/-/issues)
